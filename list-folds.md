In this talk, we go back to first principles, defining and examining the definition for a cons list, then take a look at the ubiquitous right and left fold functions on a list.

The primary focus of this talk is to develop an intuition for how these functions work so that we can best decide when to apply them. Multiple programming languages will be used to help emphasise the independence of the gained intuition. This talk will generally be interactive with the audience as we solve problems and build confidence in our new knowledge.

Knowing how to apply the various list fold functions is a common question by the student of FP. This talk aims to provide a solid, reliable answer to this question. No prior understanding of list folds is necessary.

By the way, @philipschwarz found this talk so useful that he made the following slide deck, which is centred on the talk: https://www.slideshare.net/pjschwarz/folding-unfolded-polyglot-fp-for-fun-and-profit-haskell-and-scala-part-3
